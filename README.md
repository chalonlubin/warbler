## üßê Motivation & Challenges

> This project was built in a 3.5 day sprint with @nicom as a part of Rithm School. Much of the code was given to us, it was up to us to find and fix many errors in the codebase, as well as implement certain unfinished features and build up the testing suite. 

> The major challenge with the project was it was the first time working with a codebase of decent size that we were unfamiliar with. We then had to budget time to implement fixes.
